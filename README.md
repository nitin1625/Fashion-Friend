# FashionFriend : A fashion-recommender-system

## Overview
This project implements a fashion recommender system using deep learning techniques, specifically ResNet50, a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. It provides personalized fashion recommendations to users based on their preferences and past interactions with fashion items.

## Features
- Utilizes ResNet50 for feature extraction from fashion images.
- Generates personalized fashion recommendations for users.
- Enhances user experience by suggesting relevant and trendy fashion items.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Deep Learning Framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- ResNet50 Pre-trained Model
- Fashion Dataset (e.g., FashionMNIST, DeepFashion)

## Usage
1. Input user preferences or past interactions with fashion items.
2. Run the recommender system to generate personalized recommendations.
3. Review recommended fashion items and make selections.

## How to Run
1. Clone repository.
2. Install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
3. Prepare fashion dataset for training and testing.
4. Train the ResNet50 model on the fashion dataset.
5. Deploy the recommender system for generating recommendations.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate user feedback to improve recommendation accuracy.
- Explore advanced deep learning architectures for feature extraction.
- Enhance the system with user interface and interactive features.
